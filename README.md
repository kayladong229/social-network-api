# social-network-api
Completed homework for the Module 18 Challenge. The purpose was to create an API for a social network application which uses the Mongoose ODM and express.js to store data into a MongoDB database. This data includes user information (e.g. username, email, their friend list), posts by users (referred to as "thoughts" for this API) and comments to these posts (referred to as "reactions" for this API). The API allows for the creation, modification and deletion of user information and thoughts along with the addition and deletion of reactions to thoughts and friends to users' friend lists. 

A video tutorial has also been created for this application which is linked below.
